The IP address API returns useful meta-information for IP addresses. For example, the API response includes the organization of the IP address, ASN information and geolocation intelligence.

Furthermore, the API response allows to derive security information for each IP address, for example whether an IP address belongs to a hosting provider (`is_datacenter`), is a TOR exit node (`is_tor`), if an IP address is a proxy (`is_proxy`) or belongs to an abuser (`is_abuser`).

This API strongly emphasises **datacenter/hosting detection**. A complicated hosting detection algorithm was developed to achieve a high detection rate. [Thousands of different hosting providers](https://incolumitas.com/pages/Hosting-Providers-List/) are tracked. Whois records, public hosting IP ranges from hosting providers and a proprietary hosting discovery algorithm are used to decide whether an IP address belongs to a datacenter or not.

The API includes accurate and rich ASN meta-data. For instance, the API output contains whois information for each active ASN and the ASN type is derived by analyzing the company that own the ASN.

## Quickstart

Lookup any IP address: [https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=3.5.140.2](https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=3.5.140.2)

Lookup your own IP address: [https://api.incolumitas.com/](https://api.incolumitas.com/)

Usage with JavaScript:

```JavaScript
fetch('https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=23.236.48.55')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(res => console.log(res));
```

Usage with Curl:

```bash
curl 'https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=32.5.140.2'
```

## Introduction

The IP adddress API internally uses the following data sources:

1. Public whois records from regional Internet address registries such as RIPE NCC, APNIC, ARIN and so on
2. BGP information in order to find ASN information and their associated routes/prefixes
3. Public blocklists such as [firehol/blocklist-ipset](https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets)
4. The API uses several proprietary datacenter/hosting detection algorithms
5. Other open source projects that try to find hosting IP addresses such as [github.com/client9/ipcat](https://github.com/client9/ipcat), [github.com/Umkus/ip-index](https://github.com/Umkus/ip-index) or [https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn](github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn) are also considered.
6. The API uses IP threat data from various honeypots
7. IP geolocation information from several different geolocation providers is used

## API Response Format

The API output format is explaind by walking through an example. Most of the returned information is self-explanatory.

This is how a typical API response looks like. The IP `107.174.138.172` was queried with the API call [https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=107.174.138.172](https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=107.174.138.172)):

```json
{
  "ip": "107.174.138.172",
  "rir": "ARIN",
  "is_bogon": false,
  "is_datacenter": true,
  "is_tor": true,
  "is_proxy": false,
  "is_abuser": true,
  "company": {
    "name": "ColoCrossing",
    "domain": "colocrossing.com",
    "network": "107.172.0.0 - 107.175.255.255",
    "whois": "https://api.incolumitas.com/?whois=107.172.0.0"
  },
  "datacenter": {
    "datacenter": "ColoCrossing",
    "domain": "colocrossing.com",
    "network": "107.174.138.0/24"
  },
  "asn": {
    "asn": 36352,
    "route": "107.174.138.0/24",
    "descr": "AS-COLOCROSSING, US",
    "country": "us",
    "active": true,
    "org": "ColoCrossing",
    "domain": "colocrossing.com",
    "abuse": "abuse@colocrossing.com",
    "type": "hosting",
    "created": "2005-12-12",
    "updated": "2013-01-08",
    "rir": "arin",
    "whois": "https://api.incolumitas.com/?whois=AS36352"
  },
  "location": {
    "country": "us",
    "state": "New York",
    "city": "Buffalo",
    "latitude": "42.882500",
    "longitude": "-78.878800",
    "zip": "14202",
    "timezone": "-04:00",
    "local_time": "2022-10-30T15:21:04.783Z"
  },
  "elapsed_ms": 0.84
}
```

In the following section, the different parts of the API response are explained in-depth.

### Response Format: Top Level API Output

The top level API output looks as follows:

```json
{
  "ip": "107.174.138.172",
  "rir": "ARIN",
  "is_bogon": false,
  "is_datacenter": true,
  "is_tor": true,
  "is_proxy": false,
  "is_abuser": true,
  "elapsed_ms": 0.62
}
```

The explanation for those fields is as follows:

+ `ip` - `string` - the IP address that was looked up, here it was `107.174.138.172`
+ `rir` - `string` - to which [Regional Internet Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry) the IP address belongs. Here it belongs to `ARIN`, which is the RIR responsible for North America
+ `is_bogon` - `boolean` - Whether the IP address is bogon. For example, the loopback IP `127.0.0.1` is a special/bogon IP address. The IP address `107.174.138.172` is not bogon, hence it is set to `false` here.
+ `is_datacenter` - `boolean` - whether the IP address belongs to a datacenter. Here, we have the value `true`, since `107.174.138.172` belongs to the datacenter provider ColoCrossing.
+ `is_tor` - `boolean` - is true if the IP address belongs to the TOR network. This is the case here.
+ `is_proxy` - `boolean` - whether the IP address is a proxy. This is not the case here.
+ `is_abuser` - `boolean` - is true if the IP address committed abusive actions, which was the case with `107.174.138.172`
+ `elapsed_ms` - `float` - how much internal processing time was spent in ms. This lookup only took `0.62ms`, which is quite fast.

### Response Format: The `datacenter` object

```json
  "datacenter": {
    "datacenter": "ColoCrossing",
    "domain": "colocrossing.com",
    "network": "107.174.138.0/24"
  },
```

If the IP address belongs to a datacenter/hosting provider, the API response will include a `datacenter` object with the following attributes:

+ `datacenter` - `string` - to which datacenter the IP address belongs. For a full list of datacenters, check the [api.incolumitas.com/info endpoint](https://api.incolumitas.com/info). In this case, the datacenter's name is `ColoCrossing`.
+ `domain` - `string` - The domain name of the company
+ `network` - `string` - the network this IP address belongs to (In the above case: `107.174.138.0/24`)

Most IP's don't belong to a hosting provider. In those cases, the `datacenter` object will not be present.

For a couple of large cloud providers, such as Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, DigitalOcean or Microsoft Azure (and some others), the `datacenter` object is more detailed.

Amazon AWS example:

```json
{
  "ip": "3.5.140.2",
  "datacenter": {
    "cidr": "3.5.140.0/22",
    "region": "ap-northeast-2",
    "datacenter": "Amazon AWS",
    "service": "EC2",
    "network_border_group": "ap-northeast-2"
  },
}
```

DigitalOcean example:

```json
{
  "ip": "167.99.241.135",
  "datacenter": {
    "cidr": "167.99.240.0/20",
    "datacenter": "DigitalOcean",
    "code": "60341",
    "city": "Frankfurt",
    "state": "DE-HE",
    "country": "DE"
  },
}
```

### Response Format: The `company` object

```json
  "company": {
    "name": "ColoCrossing",
    "domain": "colocrossing.com",
    "network": "107.172.0.0 - 107.175.255.255",
    "whois": "https://api.incolumitas.com/?whois=107.172.0.0"
  },
```

Most IP addresses can be associated with an organization or company. The API uses whois database information to infer which organization is the owner of a certain IP address. Most API lookups will have an `company` object with the following attributes:

+ `name` - `string` - The name of the company
+ `domain` - `string` - The domain name of the company
+ `network` - `string` - The network for which the company has ownership
+ `whois` - `string` - An url to the whois information for the network of this IP address

### Response Format: The `asn` object

```json
  "asn": {
    "asn": 36352,
    "route": "107.174.138.0/24",
    "descr": "AS-COLOCROSSING, US",
    "country": "us",
    "active": true,
    "org": "ColoCrossing",
    "domain": "colocrossing.com",
    "abuse": "abuse@colocrossing.com",
    "type": "hosting",
    "created": "2005-12-12",
    "updated": "2013-01-08",
    "rir": "arin",
    "whois": "https://api.incolumitas.com/?whois=AS36352"
  },
```

Most IP addresses can be associated with an Autonomeous System (AS). The `asn` object provides the following attributes:

+ `asn` - `int` - The AS number
+ `route` - `string` - The IP route as CIDR in this AS
+ `descr` - `string` - An informational description of the AS
+ `country` - `string` - The country where the AS is situated in (administratively)
+ `active` - `string` - Whether the AS is active (active = at least one route administred by the AS)
+ `domain` - `string` - The domain of the organization to which this AS belongs
+ `org` - `string` - The organization responisible for this AS
+ `type` - `string` - The type for this ASN, this is either `hosting`, `education`, `goverment`, `banking`, `business` or `isp`
+ `created` - `string` - When the ASN was established
+ `updated` - `string` - The last time the ASN was updated
+ `rir` - `string` - To which Regional Internet Registry the ASN belongs
+ `whois` - `string` - An url to the whois information for this ASN

For inactive autonomeous systems, most of the above information is not available.

### Response Format: The `location` object

```json
  "location": {
    "country": "us",
    "state": "New York",
    "city": "Buffalo",
    "latitude": "42.882500",
    "longitude": "-78.878800",
    "zip": "14202",
    "timezone": "-04:00",
    "local_time": "2022-10-30T15:22:31.183Z"
  },
```

The API provides geolocation information for the looked up IP address. The `location` object includes the following attributes:

+ `country` - `string` - The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code to which the IP address belongs. This is the country specific geolocation of the IP address.
+ `state` - `string` - The state for the IP address
+ `city` - `string` - The city to which the IP address belongs
+ `latitude` - `string` - The latitude for the IP address
+ `longitude` - `string` - The longitude for the IP address
+ `zip` - `string` - The zip code for this IP
+ `timezone` - `string` - The timezone for this IP
+ `local_time` - `string` - The local time for this IP
+ `possible_other_location` - `array` - (Optional) -  If there are multiple possible locations, the attribute `possible_other_location` is included in the API response. It contains an array of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes which represent the possible other geolocation countries.

Country level geolocation accuracy is quite good, since the API provides information from several different geolocation service providers.

## API Endpoints

The IP API currently has two endpoints.

### GET - `/` - Lookup a single IP address or ASN

This GET endpoint allows to lookup a single IPv4 or IPv6 IP address by specifying the query parameter `q`. Example: `q=142.250.186.110`. You can also lookup **ASN** numbers by specifying the query `q=AS209103`.

| <!-- -->         | <!-- -->                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Endpoint**       | /                                  |
| **Method**       | `GET`                                  |
| **Parameter**       | `q` - The IP address or ASN to lookup                                 |
| **Example** | [https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=3.5.140.2](https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=3.5.140.2)
| **ASN Example** | [https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=AS42831](https://api.incolumitas.com/?q=AS42831)

### POST - `/` - Lookup up to 100 IP addresses in one API call

You can also make a bulk API lookup with up to 100 IP addresses (Either IPv4 or IPv6) in one single request.

| <!-- -->         | <!-- -->                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Endpoint**       | /                                  |
| **Method**       | `POST`                                  |
| **Content-Type**       | `Content-Type: application/json`                                  |
| **Parameter**       | `ips` - An array of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to lookup                                 |

For example, in order to lookup the IP addresses

+ `162.158.0.0`
+ `2406:dafe:e0ff:ffff:ffff:ffff:dead:beef`
+ `162.88.0.0`
+ `20.41.193.225`

you can use the following POST API request with curl:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"ips": ["162.158.0.0", "2406:dafe:e0ff:ffff:ffff:ffff:dead:beef", "162.88.0.0", "20.41.193.225"]}' \
  https://api.incolumitas.com/
```
